## Topics and Abstracts

### Dirk Hartmann: Executable Digital Twins – Harnessing model order reduction to integrate the digital and real world

As the complexity of our world continues to surge, digital twins, seamlessly interfacing the physical and digital spheres, are emerging as crucial decision-making tools for complex systems. This presentation explores the transformative concept of the 'executable digital twin', a self-contained and executable model encapsulating specific behaviors within a defined context.

We will place particular emphasis on the role of non-intrusive model order reduction technology. This technology enables the generation of reduced, manageable models without compromising the essential features of the original system, thereby enhancing computational efficiency, and facilitating real-time execution. In this talk, we will not limit our focus to model order reduction technology but will consider a multitude of technologies required in the complete industrial workflow of generating and operating an 'executable digital twin'. We will cover key concepts such as the design of experiments for data generation, state estimation, calibration, as well as hybrid physics- and data-driven models.

The potential of an executable digital twin will be illustrated with selected real-world examples – from virtual thermal sensors in electric machines to optimal control of manufacturing processes.
